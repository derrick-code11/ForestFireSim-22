# ForestFireSim-22

## Description

This is a forest fire simulation program developed in Python. The program provides an interactive graphical representation of forest fires using Turtle Graphics. It also includes a text-to-speech feature to provide informative narration about forest fires and environmental data analysis.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `turtle`: Used for creating the graphical representation of the forest fire simulation.
- `matplotlib`: Used for plotting graphs and visualizing environmental datasets.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for reading data from CSV files.
- `gtts`: Used for text-to-speech conversion, enhancing user experience with informative narrations.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/forest-fire-simulation.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ForestFireSim-22`

3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib gtts pygame tkinter`

4. Run the forest fire simulation: `python main.py`

- The simulation will start, and you will see a visual representation of the forest fire.

5. View the Graph: `python graph.py`

- This will display a graph representing the environmental dataset used in the simulation.

6. Additional Notes:

- Ensure you have `Python 3.x` installed on your system.
